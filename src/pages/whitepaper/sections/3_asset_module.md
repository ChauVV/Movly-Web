## Sneaker Types
Movly sneakers exist as NFTs on the BNB Smart Chain, following the BEP-721 standard. Each sneaker NFT represents a unique health tracking sneaker with its own attributes and characteristics.

### Sneaker Specifications
- **Speed Range**: 1 - 20 km/h
- **Earning Rate**: Fixed MGD rate for any speed within range
- **Requirement**: Any form of exercise/movement will generate earnings
- **Note**: Users only need to be active to earn, regardless of speed

### Sneaker Levels
- Maximum Level: 50
- Users can level up their sneakers by burning MGD, with Movly being required at certain milestones
- Each level-up:
  - Takes predetermined time, increasing with sneaker level
  - Requires increasing amounts of MGD for all levels
  - Requires both MGD and Movly at milestone levels
  - Can be accelerated by burning additional MGD

Upon levelling, users gain additional Attribute points to assign according to their Sneaker quality:

### Sneaker Attributes
Sneakers have a single main attribute:

**Power**: 
- Determines sneaker's earning efficiency
- Affects MGD earning rate

- Higher Power means better performance and rewards

### Sneaker Quality and Power Ranges

| General | 8 | 18 |
| Knight | 15 | 35 |
| Lord | 28 | 63 |
| Sovereign | 50 | 112 |

*Note: When a sneaker is minted, its Power attribute is randomly determined within these ranges, creating unique variations even within the same quality tier.*

### Sneaker Visual Evolution
