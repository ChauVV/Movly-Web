## Drop Mechanics
Mystery Box drops are influenced by the following factors:

### Drop Value Formula

Where:
1. PSL: Player Sneaker Luck
2. PSLC: Player Sneaker Luck Coefficient (Wings/Halo bonuses)

### Quality Formula

The quality of a Mystery Box is primarily affected by:
- Amount of Mana used in a single session
- Sneaker's Luck value
