# 4.8 MGD Earning Mechanics

In Movly, users earn MGD tokens through physical activities using their NFT Sneakers. The earning system is designed to reward consistent exercise and proper movement patterns.

## Token Economics

### Maximum Supply
- MAX_SUPPLY: 6,900,000,000 MGD (6.9 billion)
- Current circulating supply: < 1.725B MGD
- Current halving count: 0
- Current earning rate: 100% (HalvingRate = 1.0)

### Halving Mechanism
The earning rate will decrease by 25% each time users have earned 25% of the remaining supply. This mechanism helps control token inflation and maintain long-term sustainability.

HalvingRate Formula:
```
HalvingRate = 0.75^halvingCount
```
Where halvingCount is the number of halvings that have occurred (currently 0).

Example of future halvings:
1. Initial supply remaining: 6.9B MGD
   - First 1.725B MGD (25%): Full earning rate (100%, HalvingRate = 0.75^0 = 1.0) - Current phase
   - Next 1.29375B MGD (25% of 5.175B): Will reduce to 75% (HalvingRate = 0.75^1 = 0.75)
   - Next 0.970312B MGD (25% of 3.88125B): Will reduce to 56.25% (HalvingRate = 0.75^2 = 0.5625)
   - And so on...

## MGD Earning Formula

Complete Formula:
```
MGD/minute = 0.35 × Quality × (1 + Power×0.01) × (1 + Level×0.02) × [(1 + Wings) × (1 + Halo)] × HalvingRate
```

Where:
- 0.35: Base rate (MGD per minute)
- Quality: Sneaker quality multiplier (1.0x - 3.0x)
- Power: Sneaker power value (1 - 112)
- Level: Sneaker level (1 - 50)
- Wings: Wings bonus (0 - 0.20)
- Halo: Halo bonus (0 - 0.20)
- HalvingRate: Current earning rate after halvings (starts at 1.0)

## Earning Mechanics

### 1. Sneaker Quality
- Base MGD earnings vary by Sneaker quality tier
- Higher quality Sneakers provide better earning potential
- Power ranges for each quality tier are defined in Section 3 (Asset Module)

Each quality tier has its own earning multiplier:
- Warrior: Base rate (1.0x)
- General: 1.5x base rate
- Knight: 2.0x base rate
- Lord: 2.5x base rate
- Sovereign: 3.0x base rate

### 2. Power Attribute
- Primary attribute affecting MGD earnings
- Higher Power increases earning efficiency
- Power can be enhanced through:
  - Leveling up
  - Wings enhancement
  - Halo enhancement

Power Bonus = Power × 0.01
- Example: Power 50 gives +50% bonus (1.5x multiplier)

### 3. Level Multiplier
Level Bonus = 1 + (Level × 0.02)
- Each level adds 2% to earnings
- Level 50 provides +100% bonus (2x multiplier)

### 4. Enhancement Bonus
Enhancement Multiplier = (1 + Wings Bonus) × (1 + Halo Bonus)

Wings/Halo Bonus calculation:
- Level 1-10: 0.05 (5% each)
- Level 11-20: 0.10 (10% each)
- Level 21-30: 0.15 (15% each)
- Level 31-40: 0.20 (20% each)

### 5. Movement Speed
- Optimal speed range: 1-20 km/h
- Speed affects earning efficiency:
  - Below 1 km/h: No earnings
  - 1-20 km/h: Full earnings
  - Above 20 km/h: Invalid movement (no earnings)

## Earning Examples

### Minimum Setup (New User)
- Warrior Sneaker (1.0x)
- Level 1 (1.02x)
- Power 1 (1.01x)
- No Wings/Halo
- 2 Mana (10 minutes)

Calculation:
0.35 × 1.0 × 1.01 × 1.02 × 1.0 = 0.36 MGD/min
Total per session: 0.36 × 10 = 3.6 MGD

### Maximum Setup
- Sovereign Sneaker (3.0x)
- Level 50 (2.0x)
- Power 112 (2.12x)
- Level 40 Wings (1.2x)
- Level 40 Halo (1.2x)
- 20 Mana (100 minutes)

Calculation:
0.35 × 3.0 × 2.12 × 2.0 × 1.44 = 6.43 MGD/min
Total per session: 6.43 × 100 = 643 MGD

## Earning Rules & Session Management
- Earnings only occur while Mana is available
- Must maintain proper movement patterns
- Trust Score affects earning capability
- Invalid movements pause earnings
- Users can view real-time earning rate
- Earnings stop when Mana depletes
- Can continue activity without earnings
- End session by holding Stop button
- Session summary shows total earnings

## Daily Limits
- Minimum daily earning (2 Mana): 3.6 MGD
- Maximum daily earning (20 Mana): 643 MGD

*Note: All earning rates and multipliers are subject to adjustment based on platform economics and community feedback.*
